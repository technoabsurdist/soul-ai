# üñåÔ∏è Craft AI

## Overview

This is an interactive tool that allows users to create and modify images through text-based prompts. Built with React and Express, the tool interfaces with OpenAI's image generation API. Start with a basic prompt like "Create an anime profile picture," then iteratively refine it with prompts such as "change background to blue."

## Features

- **Initial Image Generation**: Generate an image from a text prompt.
- **Iterative Editing**: Modify existing image using subsequent prompts.
- **Image Grid**: View all your generated images in a grid layout.
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications and loading animations provide responsive user feedback.
